Calamari Training 


 Prerequisites:

 1)  Install calamari_ocr  , using pip3 install  calamari_ocr

 2)  Prerequisite is to have the ground  truth file in the format     .gt.txt  , the ground truth file   contains the actual information in the file. This groundtruth file is present in the same directory as the train image files.

 
 Start Training:

1)  calamari-train --files your_images.*.png

The above command starts training on the images , it generates all the checkpoint files. 

Checkpoint file is the output of the training , certain progress of teh training is recorded on these checkpoints.

 Eg:

Storing checkpoint to '/home/sumanth/Downloads/klk/train/model_00000003.ckpt'


We can pass any previous checkpoints using –weights parameter.

Eg:

calamari-train –weights /home/sumanth/Documents/github/calamari_models/antiqua_modern/4.ckpt  --files *.png


The saved checkpoint is basically a combination of 4 files.

1) <model_name>.ckpt.meta

2)  <model_name>.ckpt.json

3) <model_name>.ckpt.index

4) <model_name>.ckpt.data


The last checkpoint during a training is passed to the prediction for best outcome .

calamari-predict --checkpoint path_to_model.ckpt --files your_images.*.png
